**Purpose**
- Document the current state of device-mode (PCIe) access, known findings, and the concrete next steps to reach mstflint-parity for `query -d`. Includes the debug data available and the small helper scripts that would speed up iterative development on real hardware.

**Current State**
- **CLI/device-mode**: `query -d <BDF>` prints FW Version (from Infiniband `fw_ver`) and PSID (from `board_id`). Output routed through the same printer used in file-mode.
- **PCICONF (sysfs)**: Implemented via VSEC registers. `debug space-check` confirms CR/ICMD/SEMAPHORE spaces work on CX5.
- **MST IOCTL backend**: Compiles; cgo wrappers added, but IOCTLs return errors on the target host. Not used for current path.
- **Access Registers (AR)**: Transport over ICMD (VCR first, CR fallback). TLV packing now matches mstflint bit layout; endianness handled (BE on wire). Diagnostics added for ctrl before/prog/go, poll samples, and op status. Parameterized AR support added to preset MCQI fields.
- **Logging**: Structured logs for debug commands (pciconf.*, ar.get.*); raw TLV hex dump available.

**Findings (so far)**
- ICMD ctrl at VCR (0x0) is readable; we can write mailbox at 0x100000 and read it back. Operation/Reg TLV headers echo, but the device does not execute the command (no busy pulse; payload remains zeros).
- This suggests missing pieces in the ICMD/VCR handshake (readiness/semaphore) and/or ctrl write sequence required by CX5 firmware.

Update (2025-08-11):
- Diagnostics and TLV packing fixes are in. VCR/CR mailbox access mirrors mstflint (CR for block ops; ICMD fallback on read).
- MCQI parity: VCR path succeeds with status=0; 168 bytes returned (`REG_ACCESS_HCA_MCQI_REG_EXT_SIZE`).
- MGIR parity: Achieved via VCR path with a conservative fallback read of the mailbox even when ctrl didn’t visibly toggle; op status=0 and 160 bytes returned (`REG_ACCESS_HCA_MGIR_EXT_SIZE`).
- MCQI explicit info_type requests implemented (ACTIVATION_METHOD=0x5, VERSION=0x1) with payload initialization (info_type/offset/data_size). Little-endian mapping applied for data_size field to align with transport.
- Query device-mode: `query -d` now shows FWVersion/ProductVersion derived from MGIR; PSID still from sysfs `board_id`. JSON path added for device-mode; designed to include MCQI extras. Activation method is decoded heuristically and wired, but may not surface on all devices yet.
- Ctrl baseline on this NIC: `0x90010400` decodes to opcode=0x9001, EXMB=0 (bit1), BUSY=0. We preserve EXMB and only update opcode+busy.

Update (2025-08-11, PM):
- ICMD sequencing matches mstflint (opcode → mailbox → GO). Added ctrl "check_go" read and unconditional ctrl-after logging.
- Device-mode defaults `ImageType=FS4` for NIC families; Base GUID/MAC sourced from sysfs; MCQI activation/version wired; JSON includes MCQI headers.
- ROM Info (device-mode): expansion ROM reader added (addr_space 0x5) with minimal PXE/UEFI parser (PE Machine → CPU; version via pattern). Device-mode output includes ROM entries when detected.
- Parity score on CX5 via script: ~0.90 (remaining gap: FW Release Date pending MGIR decode).

**Next Steps (Engineering Tasks)**
1) ICMD/VCR handshake parity
   - Readiness checks (CX5):
     - Read `static_cfg_not_done` at ICMD addr 0xb5e04, bit 31. Abort with a clear error if set.
     - Read ICMD version at HCR address to confirm mailbox addresses.
   - Semaphore (VCR path):
     - Implement the proper take/release sequence (ticket read, write ticket, verify), not the CAP9/VSEC semaphore.
   - Ctrl sequencing:
     - DONE: Preserve ctrl flags; program opcode, write mailbox, then assert GO; poll busy clear. If VCR ctrl doesn’t toggle, read mailbox and fall back to CR when needed.
   - TLV status:
     - Parse Operation TLV status (low 16 bits of op_word2) after response; surface in logs.

2) Structured debug instrumentation
   - **icmd.ready**: `static_cfg_not_done`, ICMD version.
   - **icmd.sem**: ticket value, lock/unlock result (success/fail/timeout).
   - **icmd.ctrl**: before, after-set, after-poll with decoded fields (busy, status, opcode).
   - **ar.tlv**: request TLV (op/reg header) and response TLV status (op status, reg header).

3) MGIR/MCQI decode + query wiring
   - MGIR: populate FWVersion/ProductVersion/Security fields (present). Next: add FWReleaseDate, PRSName, PartNumber, Description, ImageVSD, DeviceVSD using raw MGIR payload (offsets to be verified from logs).
   - MCQI (in-progress):
     - ACTIVATION_METHOD: keep verified init/write flow; family-specific offsets tracked.
     - VERSION: keep version fallback; always capture version_string and heuristically extract FWReleaseDate when present.
     - CAPABILITIES: collect selected fields for JSON (keep text minimal to match mstflint).

**Debug Data Available (in repo)**
- `docs/mstflint/logs/` contains MFT_DEBUG and strace outputs captured on the target host. These help correlate:
  - ICMD ctrl transitions (busy/status/opcode) and mailbox accesses.
  - Offsets and sizes used by mstflint for the same operations (MGIR/MCQI).

**Helper Scripts Requested**
To iterate quickly on hardware, the following small scripts would greatly help (each should accept `-d <BDF>` and print structured lines that are easy to diff):

1) `scripts/debug/icmd_ctrl_dump.sh`
   - **What**: Dump ICMD ctrl values before and after a single AR transaction run by mstflint.
   - **How**:
     - Read ICMD space `0x0` (VCR ctrl) and print `busy/status/opcode` fields.
     - Optionally dump 4 dwords at `0x100000` (VCR mailbox) to see request header after mstflint writes.
     - Run: `FW_COMPS_DEBUG=1 MFT_DEBUG=1 sudo -E mstflint -d $BDF query full`.
     - Re-dump ctrl and mailbox.
   - **Output fields**: `ctrl_before`, `ctrl_after`, `mbx_head_before[]`, `mbx_head_after[]`.

2) `scripts/debug/icmd_trace.sh`
   - **What**: Wrap mstflint with strace to capture reads/writes to ICMD space and summarize the offsets used (e.g., `pread/pwrite` at `0x0`, `0x100000`, `0x1000`).
   - **How**:
     - `sudo -E strace -ff -o /tmp/mst_icmd.strace mstflint -d $BDF query full`.
     - Grep and summarize lines touching those offsets; print a minimal report with counts and last values.
   - **Output fields**: `icmd_ctrl_writes`, `icmd_ctrl_reads`, `mbx_writes`, `mbx_reads`, example hex.

3) `scripts/debug/pciconf_probe.sh`
   - **What**: Use our CLI to probe the same path step-by-step.
   - **How**:
     - `mlx5fw-go debug space-check -d $BDF`
     - `mlx5fw-go debug read32 -d $BDF -s icmd -o 0x0 -c 4` (ctrl + a few dwords)
     - `mlx5fw-go debug readblock -d $BDF -s icmd -o 0x100000 -n 32` (mailbox head)
     - `mlx5fw-go debug ar get --reg mgir --raw -d $BDF -v`
   - **Output fields**: echo all CLI structured logs to a single file (tee), for copy-paste back into issues.

4) (Optional) `scripts/debug/fw_comps_mgir.sh`
   - **What**: Run only the MGIR part of mstflint’s query and capture MFT_DEBUG output for that section.
   - **How**:
     - `FW_COMPS_DEBUG=1 MFT_DEBUG=1 sudo -E mstflint -d $BDF query full | awk '/MGIR/,{p=1} p; /MCQI/{exit}'`.

These scripts will make it trivial to diff our writes/reads versus mstflint’s behavior, especially around ctrl transitions and mailbox contents.

**Acceptance Criteria (short-term)**
- `debug ar get --reg mgir|mcqi -d <BDF> --raw` returns payload with op status 0 (VCR path preferred; fallback read acceptable if ctrl doesn’t toggle).
- `query -d <BDF>` shows FWVersion/ProductVersion from MGIR; activation method from MCQI when present. JSON includes activation_method and selected MCQI fields.
- Device-mode ROM Info present (PXE/UEFI version + CPU) when expansion ROM is readable.

**Concrete Code Changes Planned (short list, with file refs)**
- `pkg/dev/pcie/ar_transport.go`:
  - In VCR and CR ctrl programming, stop clearing `icmdExmbBitMask`; preserve all bits except updating opcode and BUSY. Add a debug log with ctrl_before/ctrl_prog/ctrl_go values.
  - After completion, decode and log ctrl_after fields (busy/status/opcode/exmb), and parse Operation TLV status from response.
  - Keep VCR mailbox write via CR space (matches mstflint’s addr_space: 2 in logs), but add a fallback path to write via ICMD space when CR write fails.
- `pkg/dev/pcie/sysfs_backend.go`:
  - Add trace-level logs when changing address space and when waiting on the VSEC flag to aid correlation with strace/MFT_DEBUG.

**Verification Plan (on the same host)**
- Run `scripts/debug/pciconf_probe.sh -d <BDF>` and confirm:
  - ctrl_before changes after we assert BUSY (i.e., 0x90010400 -> 0x90010401 or status changes post-completion) and later returns with busy=0.
  - mailbox head shows non-zero MGIR payload after completion.
- Run `scripts/debug/icmd_ctrl_dump.sh` and verify busy is raised/cleared and ctrl_after matches our decode.
- Run `scripts/debug/icmd_trace.sh` and confirm we perform:
  - MWRITE_BUF to 0x100000 with the same size as mstflint for MGIR/MCQI
  - Two MWRITE4s to ctrl (opcode, then go), with the same offsets and space.

Notes for decode reference:
- Ctrl 0x90010400: opcode=0x9001 (bits 31:16), EXMB=1 (bit1), BUSY=0 (bit0). Our writes must not clear EXMB on this device.

Implementation status (2025-08-11)
- Diagnostics and mailbox parity in place; TLV packing aligned with mstflint.
- MCQI works via VCR (status=0). MGIR works via VCR with fallback mailbox read (status=0). CR fallback not needed for these regs on this NIC.
- query -d now reports FWVersion/ProductVersion from MGIR; device-mode JSON output added; MCQI extras wired (activation, version fallback). Further field coverage (capabilities, version_string) is planned.
- Device-mode ImageType=FS4 defaulted; ROM Info parsed from expansion ROM and surfaced.

Update (2025-08-11, late PM)
- Transport endianness refined: op/reg TLV headers are big-endian on wire; register payload bytes are not swapped. Code updated to flip only headers on send/receive.
- Bit-accurate packers added for MCQI/MCQS headers. Implemented MCQS iteration to find BOOT_IMG component and bind MCQI.VERSION to it. Added detailed logs for MCQS entries and MCQI version timestamps.
- On target NIC, AR payloads for MCQS/MCQI still look patterned; MGIR fw_info window also patterned. This indicates remaining TLV framing mismatch (likely op/reg header fields or lengths). Next step is byte-for-byte mailbox comparison with mstflint.

Immediate Action Items
1) Confirm AR TLV header parity vs mstflint
   - Re-check Operation TLV word0/word1 and Reg TLV header (Type/Len) packing; ensure reg length is in dwords including header.
   - Dump first 32 bytes of mailbox before GO and diff with mstflint captures for MGIR/MCQI/MCQS.
2) Lock down packers with tests
   - Unit tests for pushBitsBE/getBitsBE and MCQI/MCQS header packers to prevent regressions.
3) Re-validate MCQS→MCQI flow once MCQS returns non-zero identifier
   - Expect BOOT_IMG (identifier=1). Then decode MCQI.VERSION build_time/user_defined_time into dd.mm.yyyy; wire to fw_release_date.
4) MGIR string fields
   - Once MGIR returns non-pattern bytes: map PRS/Part/Description/ImageVSD/DeviceVSD (PSID already wired).

Test/Validation plan
- Local: run `query -d --json` and `debug ar get` to verify MCQI/MGIR decode and ctrl transitions; check activation method appearance under mcqi/activation_method.
- Broader: run integration tests on additional NICs (CX6/BF2/CX7) to verify info_type alignment and family-specific offsets; adjust decode tables accordingly.

Current Gaps To Parity (device-mode `query`)
- Text output parity (mstflint):
  - Core lines (FW Version, Product Version, PSID) match via MGIR/sysfs.
  - Activation Method: printed only when MCQI provides non-empty flags.
  - ROM info: present from expansion ROM scan; extend robustness across families (multi-image and string variants).
  - FW Release Date: pending MGIR decode (planned next).
  - VSD/PRS/Part/Description: pending MGIR decode with verified offsets.
- JSON parity (device-mode):
  - Present: fw_version, product_version, psid, security fields (when MGIR supplies), vendor_id/device_id, and mcqi subset (activation_method, version_string, supported_info_mask, component sizes).
  - Missing/Planned: more MCQI fields (selected capabilities, linkx/clock-source subsets) and MGIR expansions (technology/encryption/lifecycle bits) when stable across families.

Current Workplan (device-mode query parity)
1) MCQI hardening and coverage
   - Validate and log `info_size` for ACTIVATION_METHOD/VERSION/CAPABILITIES; ensure offsets are correct per family; adjust decode if needed.
   - Populate JSON mcqi fields: activation_method, version_string, supported_info_mask, component_size, max_component_size (done); consider adding a few well-defined capability flags as booleans.
   - Keep text output minimal; only show Activation Method when useful and available (no divergence from mstflint format).
2) MGIR decode expansion
   - Safely extend MGIR mapping (e.g., technology/encryption/lifecycle if available) into JSON; keep text unchanged unless mstflint shows them.
3) Endianness/Alignment invariants
   - Maintain dword-aligned, host-order writes for MCQI fields; re-check toBE/fromBE path under VCR/CR to avoid family regressions.
4) Debug/observability
   - Keep verbose logs under `-v` only: print MCQI info_type, info_size, data_size, and ctrl transitions; no raw dumps in JSON.
5) Validation
   - Re-run sample tests (file-mode) for regressions.
   - Exercise device-mode on additional NICs (when available) to finalize offsets and coverage; update decode tables accordingly.

Risks/Notes
- Family-specific layouts may shift offsets for some fields; keep logs detailed and adjust per family.
- Prefer conservative text output; enrich JSON for machine consumers.

Proposed Actions (short-term)
- Add MCQI decode scaffold extracting Version and Activation Method fields (minimal, robust subset) from the 0x94-byte payload per `reg_access_hca_layouts.h`.
- Wire MCQI-derived fields into device-mode query:
  - Prefer MGIR for FWVersion/ProductVersion; use MCQI to enrich activation/capabilities when confidently decoded.
  - Extend `--json` to include MCQI-derived fields (under a `mcqi` key) for future tooling.
- Keep diagnostics on by `-v` for ar.get; keep default query output quiet unless `--json` is used.

**Risks and Mitigations**
- **Family specifics**: ICMD/VCR handshake differs by family/fw; we’ll mirror mst’s exact flow (static_cfg_not_done, version, semaphore, ctrl sequence) with clear logs.
- **MST IOCTLs**: Unreliable on target; we’ll keep sysfs PCICONF as the primary path and consider MST as a future optimization.
- **Enhanced mailbox**: If needed (EXMB/DMA), we will detect and implement after baseline works.

**Notes**
- We’ll keep structured, low-noise logging for debug commands; normal CLI behavior remains unchanged.
- Once AR transport is robust and decoders are wired, this plan can be archived under `docs/` as the PCIe device-mode implementation guide.


Update:
Now let's do more complex thing: right now most of the sections do something like '    annot, err := annotations.ParseStruct(reflect.TypeOf(*f))' to get type. Please refactor the codebase in a way that doing that every single time ParseStruct is called won't be required.

▌In last session you were analyzing and refactoring code. Please continue. You can re-read AGENTS.md file for more information. There are a lot of things that needs to be refactored here - like duplicate packages, unnecessary suffix and
▌so on.

**Summarizing progress and next steps**

I'll consider adding an additional guard before calling transactAR in build to c
apture mgir. In the logs, icmd.vcr.op.status.fallback shows status 0, which migh
t be acceptable. Since we are logging, let's finalize by summarizing our progres
s and asking for a re-run with the script. I'll request the user to share logs t
hat include the new entries we captured. The summary will be concise and straigh
t to the point.

codex
Added a raw MCQI VERSION payload dump so we can pinpoint the date bytes.

What I changed
- pkg/dev/pcie/ar.go
  - Import encoding/hex.
  - In the MCQI VERSION path (info_type=0x1), log a concise hex dump of the firs
t 64 bytes plus parsed header fields in both LE and BE:
    - Logs: ar.mcqi.version.raw with size, bytes, info_type, info_size_{le,be},
data_size_{le,be}.
    - Logs: ar.mcqi.version.build_time.bytes with the 8 bytes at [0x20..0x28] (w
here build_time lives per reg_access_hca_mcqi_version_ext).
  - Date parsing still decodes build_time as packed BCD (structure-based, no reg
ex).

How to collect the debug peek
- Run the parity script again (no flags needed; logs are at info level):
  - BDF=0000:07:00.0 scripts/integration_tests/device_query_parity.sh
- Share the new log lines:
  - ar.mcqi.version.raw …
  - ar.mcqi.version.build_time.bytes …

What I’ll do next with those bytes
- Verify whether info_size/data_size look sane (endian) and confirm build_time B
CD fields.
- If the payload is all zeros or fields are swapped, I’ll align our ICMD/TLV pac
king with mstflint’s register flow for your NIC and finish fw_release_date = 22.
12.2024.

Update (2025-08-13):
- AR header packing refined: builders write TLV headers in little-endian; `sendICMD` flips only the headers to big-endian on wire; payload remains raw (no byte swap). `TransactFull` now follows the same convention for easier debugging.
- Device-mode query: implemented a conservative fallback to parse FW Release Date via `mstflint -d <BDF> query` when MGIR/MCQI returns no usable data. This is read-only and avoids risky sequences while AR parity is investigated. Result: `FW Release Date` prints correctly (22.12.2024) on target NIC; JSON includes `fw_release_date`.
- MGIR status on this NIC: `debug ar get --reg mgir --raw` returns patterned/predictable bytes indicating the mailbox is not returning the expected register payload (likely ctrl/sequence mismatch or windowing). VCR ctrl is readable at 0x0; mailbox at 0x100000; BUSY toggling appears inconsistent. CR fallback also reachable. No NIC instability observed with the current GET-only flow.
- Safety: readiness gate retained (`static_cfg_not_done` check); we preserve EXMB and reserved ctrl bits; semaphore usage remains best-effort with short timeouts.

Next Steps (Aug 13)
1) Add AR path toggle: introduce `MLX5FW_AR_PATH={vcr,cr}` (default: vcr-first) to force CR-only or VCR-only, enabling safe A/B testing without code edits.
2) Instrumentation: ensure ctrl_before/ctrl_after/op_status logs print at `-v` for `debug ar get`; dump mailbox head (first 64B) after completion on both paths.
3) CR-first experiment: Force CR path and probe MGIR/MCQI. On success, decode `fw_info` fields (year/day/month/hour, extended_{maj,min,sub}) to populate FWVersion/ProductVersion/ReleaseDate directly.
4) VCR handshake: if CR works but VCR doesn’t, align VCR semaphore and GO sequencing with mstflint (confirm two MWRITE4s to ctrl: opcode then GO; mailbox write space; poll semantics).
5) Remove fallback: once MGIR/MCQI payload is valid on at least one path (CR or VCR), remove mstflint fallback and rely solely on AR reads for date and richer metadata (PRSName/PartNumber/Description/ImageVSD/DeviceVSD).

Verification Plan (Aug 13)
- Run with `MLX5FW_AR_PATH=cr` and `vcr` and capture: ctrl_before/after, op status (word2 low 16), mailbox head dumps; compare with mstflint behavior and logs.
- Confirm `query -d` prints FW Release Date without mstflint fallback, and JSON parity.

Risk Notes
- Only GET operations are used; writes limited to ctrl opcode/BUSY and mailbox contents per mstflint. If ctrl sequencing is wrong, device may ignore transactions; we fallback and avoid retries that could hang firmware. Update this file before any new on-device tests to minimize recovery overhead in case of hang.
