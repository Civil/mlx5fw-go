# Session: Fixing BOOT2 Binary Extraction Issue

## Problem
The extract-reassemble pipeline is broken because sections with `has_raw_data=true` (like BOOT2) are not creating binary files during extraction, only JSON files. This causes reassembly to fail with "section has raw data flag but binary file not found: BOOT2_0x00001000.bin"

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The parser creates BOOT2 and TOOLS_AREA sections from HW pointers but doesn't load their data
2. In `parser.go`, when creating sections from HW pointers, only metadata is set but `Data` field is left empty
3. The extractor checks `section.GetRawData()` and finds it nil, so it tries to load data using `ReadSectionData()`
4. However, the section's Parse() method is called with this data, but the raw data isn't stored in the section properly
5. The `has_raw_data` flag is correctly set in Boot2Section constructor, but without actual data, no binary file is written

## Current Status
Successfully fixed the two critical issues:
1. **Fixed ITOC parsing** - Removed the `Data [32]byte` field that had `offset:"-"` preventing unmarshal
2. **Fixed BOOT2/TOOLS_AREA binary extraction** - Modified `addLegacySection()` to use `CreateSectionFromData` when data is available
   - BOOT2 binary files are now being created properly
   - TOOLS_AREA binary files are now being created properly
   
New issue discovered:
- Gap count mismatch during reassembly: "expected 28 gaps, found 29"

## Discovered Issue: Legacy Code Remnants
The codebase has incomplete refactoring with two parallel section storage systems:
- `legacySections`: map[uint16][]*interfaces.Section (old struct-based)
- `sections`: map[uint16][]interfaces.SectionInterface (new interface-based)

The `addLegacySection()` method creates both, but doesn't properly pass the Data field when creating the new interface.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix BOOT2 Data Loading (Current Task)
- Need to ensure `CreateSectionFromData` is called when section.Data is available
- The factory has this method but `addLegacySection` doesn't use it
- This will fix the immediate BOOT2 binary extraction issue

### 2. Remove legacySections Completely
- Remove `legacySections` field from Parser struct
- Remove `GetSections()` method (returns legacy sections)
- Rename `GetSectionsNew()` to `GetSections()`
- Update `addLegacySection()` to only create new interface sections
- Remove all references to `interfaces.Section` struct
- Update any code that still uses the legacy interface

### 3. Clean Up Section Creation Flow
- Sections from HW pointers should be created with data loaded
- Ensure all section types properly implement the interface
- Verify the factory properly initializes sections with data

## Code Locations
- Parser section creation: `pkg/parser/fs4/parser.go`
  - `parseBoot2()` - lines 661-711
  - `parseToolsArea()` - lines 596-656
  - `addLegacySection()` - lines 426-471
- Section factory: `pkg/types/sections/factory.go`
  - `CreateSectionFromData()` - line 151
- Extractor: `pkg/extract/extractor.go`
  - Data loading logic - lines 106-129

## Testing
After fixes, run:
```bash
./test.sh extract
./scripts/sample_tests/strict-reassemble.sh
```

The BOOT2_0x00001000.bin file should be created during extraction.
