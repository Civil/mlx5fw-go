## Progress

### Update - 2025-07-29 00:15 AM

**Summary**: Fixed FS5 detection and identified remaining issues

### Update - 2025-07-31 23:15 PM

**Summary**: Fixed bit field parsing and Product Version display issues, achieving 100% test pass rate

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: pkg/parser/fs4/query.go, pkg/types/image_info_aliases.go, pkg/types/image_info_annotated.go
- Current branch: master (commit: 90a5a60 wip. working)

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Fix bit field positions to match original parseSecurityAttributes logic
- âœ“ Completed: Fix security attribute parsing - all firmwares showing secure-fw instead of N/A
- âœ“ Completed: Rewrite ImageInfo to use byte fields instead of bit fields for correct parsing
- âœ“ Completed: Fix ConnectX7 firmware test failures - only difference is extra Product Version field
- âœ“ Completed: Fix ConnectX8 signed firmware detection
- âœ“ Completed: Verify final test success rate reaches 100%

**Issues Encountered**:
1. Bit field parsing was using MSB=0 numbering while original code used LSB=0
2. Security attributes were incorrectly showing "secure-fw" for all firmwares
3. Product Version was being displayed even when empty, unlike mstflint

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Corrected bit positions in ImageInfoAnnotated to account for MSB=0 bit numbering convention
2. Fixed GetProductVerString() to return empty string when ProductVer field is empty
3. Test success rate improved from 59.3% to 100%

**Code Changes**:
- Updated bit field positions in ImageInfoAnnotated struct to correct MSB=0 positions
- Modified GetProductVerString() to match mstflint behavior
- All query outputs now match mstflint exactly

**Next TODO**:
- Analyze and fix strict-reassemble test failures - the tests are correctly reporting issues with firmware reassembly functionality

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: cmd/mlx5fw-go/common.go (added FS5 detection logic with debug)
- Modified: pkg/parser/fs4/parser.go (added format field and SetFormat method)

### Update - 2025-08-01 00:00 AM

**Summary**: Fixed all remaining test failures in query and strict-reassemble tests

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: pkg/types/image_info_annotated.go (fixed bit field positions for MSB=0 numbering)
- Modified: pkg/types/image_info_aliases.go (fixed GetProductVerString to return empty when no product version)
- Modified: pkg/reassemble/image_info_reconstructor.go (fixed bit field extraction to use correct LSB=0 positions)
- Current branch: master (commit: 90a5a60 wip. working)

**Todo Progress**: 11 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Analyze strict-reassemble test failures
- âœ“ Completed: Fix IMAGE_INFO reconstruction to use corrected MSB=0 bit positions
- âœ“ Completed: Run full strict-reassemble test suite
- âœ“ Completed: Fix firmware reassembly functionality issues
- âœ“ Completed: Ensure all strict-reassemble tests pass

**Issues Encountered**:
1. Bit field parsing was using MSB=0 numbering while original code used LSB=0
2. IMAGE_INFO reconstruction was using old bit positions
3. Product Version field was shown even when empty, unlike mstflint

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Corrected all bit positions in ImageInfoAnnotated for MSB=0 convention
2. Updated reconstructImageInfo to extract bit fields using LSB=0 positions
3. Fixed GetProductVerString() to return empty string when ProductVer is empty

**Test Results**:
- query.sh: 100% success rate (was 59.3%)
- strict-reassemble.sh: 100% success rate (was 0%)

All firmware files now reassemble to byte-for-byte identical copies of the originals
- Modified: pkg/parser/fs4/query.go (fixed DEV_INFO/MFG_INFO lookups, added Virtio ROM types)
- Modified: pkg/types/constants.go (added boot version constants)
- Added: pkg/types/boot_version.go (boot version structure for format detection - fixed bit layout)
- Current branch: master (commit: 72d42eb wip)

**Todo Progress**: 9 completed, 1 in progress, 4 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Fix GuidsNumber/Base GUID/Base MAC always showing 8
- âœ“ Completed: Fix missing Virtio ROM info entries  
- âœ“ Completed: Fix FS5 image type detected as FS4
- âš¡ In Progress: Fix CX7 encrypted firmware dual GUID/MAC format
- ðŸ“‹ Pending: Fix missing Product Version field in some outputs
- ðŸ“‹ Pending: Create FS5 parser implementation
- ðŸ“‹ Pending: Implement VPD parsing using annotations

**Details**: 
- Fixed GUID/MAC detection by correcting DEV_INFO section type lookup
- Added Virtio ROM type support (product IDs 0x14 and 0x15)
- Fixed FS5 format detection - boot version structure bit layout was incorrect
  - image_format_version is at bits 0-7, not 24-31
  - Based on mstflint's image_layout_boot_version_unpack function
- Test score improved from 0.0769231 to 0.846154 (from ~8% to ~85% passing)
- Identified dual GUID/MAC format issue:
  - mstflint uses GUID1/GUID2/MAC1/MAC2 format when guid_format is CIB_UIDS
  - This happens for encrypted firmware without DEV_INFO sections
  - VPD parsing is missing which may contain GUID/MAC data

**Remaining Issues**:
1. CX7 encrypted firmware shows single GUID/MAC format instead of dual
2. Missing "Orig PSID" field (only shown when different from PSID)
3. Product Version added to some outputs where mstflint doesn't show it
4. VPD sections not being parsed (size 0 in test files)

**Next Steps**:
- Implement VPD parsing using annotations package
- Handle dual GUID format for encrypted firmware
- Investigate Product Version display logic

15. âœ… Fix missing 'dev' security attribute for MCX6-DX-EVB-SB-INT firmware

**Pending Tasks**:
1. ðŸ“‹ Create FS5 parser implementation (high priority)
2. ðŸ“‹ Implement VPD parsing using annotations (high priority)

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Achieved 100% test compatibility** - All 26 firmware query tests now pass
2. **Fixed critical parsing bugs**:
   - Section type lookup using wrong bitmasks for DEV_INFO/MFG_INFO
   - Missing Virtio ROM types (UEFI Virtio net/blk)
   - Incorrect FS5 format detection
   - Truncated field sizes not matching mstflint
3. **Implemented advanced features**:
   - Dual GUID/MAC format for encrypted firmware
   - Security attribute detection from IMAGE_SIGNATURE sections
   - Boot version-based format detection (FS4 vs FS5)

### Features Implemented
1. **FS5 Format Detection**:
   - Created boot version structure with proper bit layout
   - Reads boot version at offset 0x10 from magic pattern
   - Correctly identifies FS5 firmware (ConnectX-8)

2. **Dual GUID/MAC Format**:
   - Detects encrypted firmware without DEV_INFO sections
   - Displays GUID1/GUID2/MAC1/MAC2 format with N/A values
   - Shows Orig PSID field for encrypted firmware

3. **Security Attributes Enhancement**:
   - Parses IMAGE_SIGNATURE_256/512 sections
   - Checks keypair_uuid for development firmware detection
   - Properly merges attributes from multiple sources

4. **Field Size Corrections**:
   - PartNumber: 32 bytes â†’ 64 bytes
   - PRSName: 64 bytes â†’ 128 bytes
   - Matches mstflint's connectx4_image_info structure

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Problem**: Wrong section type lookups (using 0xe0e1 instead of 0xe1)
   - **Solution**: Removed incorrect bitmask operations, use raw type values

2. **Problem**: Boot version bit layout confusion
   - **Solution**: Analyzed mstflint source, found image_format_version at bits 0-7

3. **Problem**: Product Version showing when it shouldn't
   - **Solution**: Only display if actually present in IMAGE_INFO, not derived

4. **Problem**: Missing 'dev' security attribute
   - **Solution**: Parse IMAGE_SIGNATURE sections and check keypair_uuid pattern

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes maintain backward compatibility

### Important Findings
1. **VPD Not Parsed**: User hinted that VPD parsing was removed during annotated migration
2. **Dual Format Logic**: Based on encryption status and DEV_INFO presence, not VPD
3. **Security Attributes**: Come from both IMAGE_INFO header and IMAGE_SIGNATURE sections
4. **Field Sizes**: mstflint uses larger fields than initially implemented

### Dependencies Added/Removed
None - used existing packages

### Configuration Changes
None - no configuration files modified

### Deployment Steps
1. Build with: `go build -o mlx5fw-go ./cmd/mlx5fw-go`
2. Test with: `./scripts/sample_tests/query.sh`
3. No additional deployment steps required

### Lessons Learned
1. **Always check mstflint source** - Documentation can be incomplete
2. **Bit field layouts matter** - Endianness and bit positions are critical
3. **Test incrementally** - Each fix revealed new issues
4. **Debug output is invaluable** - FW_COMPS_DEBUG=1 provided crucial insights
5. **Field sizes in C structs** - Array sizes like [65] include null terminator

### What Wasn't Completed
1. **FS5 Parser Implementation** - Detection works but full FS5 parsing not implemented
2. **VPD Parsing** - Identified as needed but not implemented
3. **Committing Changes** - All work remains uncommitted per user preference

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Use query.sh test script** - Provides immediate feedback on compatibility
2. **Check mstflint source in reference/** - Contains the ground truth implementation
3. **Test with diverse firmware** - Each firmware type reveals different edge cases
4. **Watch for field truncation** - String fields have specific size limits
5. **Security attributes are complex** - Multiple sources must be checked and merged
6. **Format detection is critical** - FS4/FS5 have different structures
7. **Encrypted firmware is special** - Different display format and missing sections

### Additional Notes
- The test score progression: 7.7% â†’ 23% â†’ 85% â†’ 88.5% â†’ 92.3% â†’ 100%
- Each fix uncovered new issues, showing the importance of comprehensive testing
- The codebase follows good practices with zap logging and merry error handling
- User was knowledgeable about the codebase and provided helpful hints
