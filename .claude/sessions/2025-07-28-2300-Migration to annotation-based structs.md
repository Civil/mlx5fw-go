### Key Accomplishments
- Session was initialized but no implementation work was completed

### Features Implemented
- None

### Problems Encountered
- Session ended immediately after creation

### Breaking Changes
- None

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- None

### Configuration Changes
- Created `.claude/sessions/` directory structure
- Created session tracking file `.claude/sessions/.current-session`

### Deployment Steps
- None

### Lessons Learned
- Session was ended before any migration work could begin

### What Wasn't Completed
- All planned migration tasks remain incomplete
- No analysis of current struct implementation
- No design work for annotation-based approach
- No implementation of annotation parser
- No migration of existing structs
- No test or documentation updates

### Tips for Future Developers
- The project appears to be in the middle of a migration to annotation-based structs
- There are uncommitted changes in parser and types packages that may be related to this work
- Review the existing changes in `pkg/types/itoc_annotated.go` as it likely contains the start of the annotation implementation
- The parser changes in `pkg/parser/fs4/parser.go` and `pkg/parser/toc_reader.go` may need to be completed
- Consider reviewing the existing "wip" commits to understand the migration direction
