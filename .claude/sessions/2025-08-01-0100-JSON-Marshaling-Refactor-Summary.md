# JSON Marshaling Refactor - Comprehensive Summary

## Overview
This session focused on refactoring JSON marshaling from map[string]interface{} to direct struct annotations. The refactoring is **partially complete** with significant legacy code remaining.

## Current State (as of 2025-08-05)
- **Test Results**: All tests passing (100% success rate)
  - sections.sh: 100% pass rate
  - query.sh: 100% pass rate  
  - strict-reassemble.sh: 100% pass rate
- **Functionality**: Fully working after fixing HASHES_TABLE CRC validation issue
- **Refactoring Progress**: ~60% complete - significant legacy code remains

## Major Achievements
1. **BaseSection Fields Made Public** with JSON tags
   - Renamed to avoid Go naming conflicts (Offset→SectionOffset, Size→SectionSize, etc.)
   - Added `offset:"-"` to exclude from binary marshaling
   - Removed BaseSection's MarshalJSON to eliminate embedding conflicts

2. **Type System Improvements**
   - Added MarshalJSON/UnmarshalJSON to CRCType (marshals as string: "IN_SECTION", "IN_ITOC_ENTRY", etc.)
   - Created custom SectionType with JSON marshaling (outputs both ID and name)
   - Created FWByteSlice helper for automatic hex encoding/decoding

3. **Critical Fixes**
   - Fixed HASHES_TABLE dynamic size calculation: (4 + DwSize) * 4
   - Fixed double CRC byte subtraction in BaseSection.VerifyCRC
   - Fixed TOOLS_AREA CRC byte order (CRC in lower 16 bits)
   - Fixed annotations package to handle `offset:"-"` tags
   - Fixed DEV_INFO size overflow (514→512 bytes)

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Priority - Legacy Code Removal
1. **Remove SectionJSON type entirely** (pkg/types/json_types.go)
   - User feedback: "Why do you even need SectionJSON? Part of refactoring was to get rid of all the duplication"
   - Sections should marshal/unmarshal themselves directly

2. **Complete interface migration**
   - Remove all references to `interfaces.Section` struct
   - Only use `interfaces.SectionInterface`
   - Update any remaining code using the legacy interface

3. **Section types still using old JSON format**
   - generic_section.go (most sections use this)
   - dtoc_sections.go (all DTOC section types)
   - debug_sections.go
   - tools_area_extended_section.go

### Medium Priority - Consistency
4. **Reassembler improvements**
   - Extend reconstructFromJSONByType for all section types
   - Currently only handles: ImageInfo, DevInfo, MfgInfo, HashesTable, ForbiddenVersions, Signatures
   - Missing: Boot2, Generic sections, DTOC sections, Debug sections

5. **Test coverage**
   - Add tests for new JSON marshaling/unmarshaling
   - Test edge cases for each section type
   - Verify binary compatibility isn't broken

### Low Priority - Cleanup
6. **Documentation**
   - Document the new JSON format
   - Update API documentation
   - Add examples of JSON extraction/reassembly

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Embedding Conflicts**
- BaseSection's MarshalJSON was overriding section-specific marshaling
- Solution: Remove MarshalJSON from embedded types, use struct tags

### 2. **Go Naming Restrictions**
- Cannot have fields and methods with same name
- Had to rename BaseSection fields (Offset→SectionOffset, etc.)

### 3. **CRC Handler Design**
- Handlers should receive full data and manage CRC extraction internally
- Don't pre-process data before passing to handlers

### 4. **Test-Driven Refactoring**
- Always run full test suite after changes
- sections.sh is particularly sensitive to validation logic changes
- Use test-runner-analyzer agent for comprehensive testing

### 5. **Binary Compatibility**
- JSON changes must not affect binary parsing/reconstruction
- Use `offset:"-"` tags to exclude JSON-only fields from binary marshaling

### 6. **Type Unification Philosophy**
- Goal: Single type system for parsing, extraction, and reassembly
- Avoid duplication and intermediate types
- Let sections handle their own JSON representation

## Code Patterns to Follow

### Adding JSON Support to New Section Types
```go
type MySection struct {
    interfaces.BaseSection
    // Add json tags to all fields that should be in JSON
    MyField uint32 `json:"my_field" offset:"byte:0"`
    MyData  FWByteSlice `json:"data,omitempty" offset:"byte:4,size:100"`
}

// No need for custom MarshalJSON if using struct tags
// BaseSection fields are already tagged
```

### Reassembler Pattern
```go
case "MY_SECTION":
    var sectionData MySection
    if err := json.Unmarshal(jsonBytes, &sectionData); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // Convert to binary...
```

## Critical Code Locations
- **Section Factory**: pkg/types/sections/factory.go
- **TOC Reader**: pkg/parser/toc_reader.go (handles ITOC/DTOC parsing)
- **CRC Handlers**: pkg/crc/handlers.go
- **Reassembler**: pkg/reassemble/reassembler_json.go
- **BaseSection**: pkg/interfaces/section.go

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Always run these three tests after changes:
./scripts/sample_tests/sections.sh    # Section validation
./scripts/sample_tests/query.sh       # Query compatibility
./scripts/sample_tests/strict-reassemble.sh  # Extract/reassemble

# Use test-runner-analyzer agent for comprehensive testing
# Use golang-code-reviewer agent after implementation
```

## Next Session Starting Points
1. Start by removing SectionJSON type and updating extractor/reassembler
2. Add JSON tags to remaining section types (focus on generic_section.go first)
3. Extend reassembler's reconstructFromJSONByType for all sections
4. Run full test suite and fix any regressions
5. Consider creating a unified test for JSON marshaling/unmarshaling

## Important Notes
- The refactoring improved code quality but introduced subtle bugs
- All bugs have been fixed, but vigilance is needed for future changes
- Binary compatibility must be maintained at all costs
- User strongly prefers type unification over duplication
