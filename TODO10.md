Main design decisions:
 * End goal is a CLI tool, it must not have any API or metrics, nor microservices
 * Data representation must match mstflint by default, json output must be present for query and sections command.
 * Focus on FS4 and FS5 firmware formats for now. It might be extended to FS3 later.
 * Performance doesn't matter. RAM ussage is irrelevant. Single-threaded code is enough. Firmwares guranteed to be smaller than 128MB uncompressed.
 * Project must use ideomatic Go 1.24
 * Project must not use any magic constants unless mstflint did the same, if you encounter such thing you must put a reference to mstflint source code that do the same.
 * Project must interpret structures and parse sections by converting them to structs using annotations that are implemented in pkg
 * Use uber-go/zap for structured logging
 * ansel1/merry for error handling
 * For all reassemble methods, you must always recompute CRCs and never rely on saving them before hands, as while strict-reassembly test doesn't modify files, but one of the main use cases for the software is to be able to easiy extract firmware, modify it and reassmble back.

Project structure:
 * cmd/mlx5fw-go/ - folder where main application is. It must contain only command line flags parsing, logging initialization and initialization of main parsing structures
 * pkg/types/ - folder where all the structs for firmware parsing must be placed. Marshaling and unmarshaling must be contained in types.
 * pkg/interfaces/ - folder where all interfaces (if any) must be placed
 * pkg/errs/ - folder where all the errors are defined

Available testing infrastucture:
 - `scripts/integration_tests/` - runs on firmwares from `sample_firmwares/` folder and on a random set of external firmwares. Tests can't be modified by anyone (score from 0 to 1, where 1 means 100% tests completed successfully)
 - `scripts/sample_tests/` - verbose tests on smaller set of firmwares. Can be inspected (test score from 0 to 1 in the end, 1 means 100% complete successfully)

 For all the tests, you must assume they are implemented correctly and never modify them. If it is doesn't use some flag - it is for a reason.

To build the project: go build ./cmd/mlx5fw-go
To run tests (from project root): `scripts/sample_tests/sections.sh` and `scripts/sample_tests/strict-reassemble.sh`
To run mlx5fw-go with verbose logging: ./mlx5fw-go -v <...>
To run mstflint: mstflint -i <FILENAME> <command>
To run mstflint with debug logging: export FW_COMPS_DEBUG=1 && mstflint -i <FILENAME> <command>

Do not use stderr redirection with mstflint as it doesn't work with it.

**Tips for Future Developers**:
1. When debugging firmware parsing issues, always compare hex dumps of original vs reassembled files
2. Use the strict-reassemble test as the ultimate validation - it catches subtle parsing errors
3. Pay special attention to bit field definitions in annotated structures
4. The `hex_as_dec` annotation flag is crucial for BCD-encoded fields
5. Run `go build ./cmd/mlx5fw-go/` after any annotation changes
6. Test with specific firmware files first before running the full test suite
7. **Always test both query and reassembly** - They exercise different code paths
8. **Pay attention to bit numbering** - Check if using MSB=0 or LSB=0 convention
9. **Test with all firmware types** - Different firmwares reveal different edge cases
10. **Use debug logging** - Helps track down bit field parsing issues

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Always verify bit field definitions don't overlap, especially in packed structures
2. Time fields in firmware structures often use BCD encoding
3. Field names can be misleading (e.g., FlashAddrDwords actually contains byte addresses)
4. Systematic debugging with specific test cases is more effective than trying to fix all issues at once
5. The IMAGE_INFO structure uses BCD encoding for time fields (hour, minutes, seconds)
6. Bit field definitions must be carefully checked for overlaps in packed structures
8. **Bit numbering conventions are critical** - MSB=0 vs LSB=0 can cause subtle bugs
9. **Comprehensive testing reveals hidden issues** - strict-reassemble tests caught reconstruction bugs
10. **Field-by-field validation important** - Product Version issue only visible in specific firmwares
11. User specifically requested to fix bugs rather than revert changes
12. Emphasized proper field parsing without shortcuts
13. All test failures have been resolved with 100% pass rate on both test suites


Please resume session `.claude/sessions/2025-08-01-0100-JSON-Marshaling-Refactor-Summary.md` (by reading .claude/sessions/2025-08-01-0100-JSON-Marshaling-Refactor-Summary.md file) and continue work that is marked there as Issues and TODO and continue working on fixing tests.

After implementing each TODO item that you identify, you must put small report into claude-logs/REPORT.md (previous report should be renamed for preservation reasons) that is focused on changes that were done and problems encountered, in case the TODO item would break any tests. Then you MUST use test-runner subagent to run tests and if they do not pass - iterate over REPORT items to identify where the bugs were introduced. After that you MUST run code-review subagent and replace claude-logs/TODO.md with the dump of current TODO and ideas that needs to be implemented next.

Expert C/C++ Embedded Software Engineer with excelent technical writing skills and pasion for debugging. Whenever question about "what mstflint do in this case" your task is to analyze source code of mstflint (/home/civil/go/src/github.com/Civil/mlx5fw-go/reference/mstflint) and if needed run required commands in debug mode (`export FW_COMPS_DEBUG=1 && mstflint -i ...`) or under gdb to investigate behavior, and as a result you are contributing to extensive Knowledge Base that is stored in /home/civil/go/src/github.com/Civil/mlx5fw-go/docs/ and answer questions on how some of the things works.
