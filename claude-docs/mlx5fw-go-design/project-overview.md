# MLX5FW-GO Project Overview

## Introduction

MLX5FW-GO is a Go implementation for parsing and manipulating Mellanox firmware files, specifically designed to handle FS4 and FS5 firmware formats. The project provides functionality similar to mstflint but with a focus on modularity, type safety, and ease of integration.

## Project Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. **Firmware Parsing**: Read and parse Mellanox firmware binary files
2. **Section Management**: Extract, modify, and reassemble firmware sections
3. **CRC Verification**: Calculate and verify various CRC types used in firmware
4. **Query Operations**: Extract firmware metadata and information
5. **Firmware Manipulation**: Support for section replacement and firmware reassembly

## Key Features

- Support for FS4 and FS5 firmware formats
- Encrypted firmware detection and partial support
- Multiple CRC algorithm implementations (hardware/software CRC16, CRC32)
- Section-specific parsing for various firmware components
- JSON output support for integration with other tools
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.22+
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra (github.com/spf13/cobra)
- **Logging**: Zap (go.uber.org/zap)
- **Binary Parsing**: 
  - Custom annotations package (pkg/annotations) for struct-based parsing
  - binstruct (github.com/ghostiam/binstruct) for certain parsing tasks
- **Error Handling**: Merry (github.com/ansel1/merry/v2)
- **Testing**: testify (github.com/stretchr/testify)

## Project Status

Currently in active development for implementing firmware flashing functionality. The parsing and query capabilities are mature, while the burn/flash operations are being designed based on mstflint's implementation.
