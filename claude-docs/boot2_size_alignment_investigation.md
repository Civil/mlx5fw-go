# BOOT2 Section Size and Alignment Investigation

## Summary

There's a 4-byte difference between how mstflint and mlx5fw-go calculate the BOOT2 section size. The investigation reveals that this is likely due to how the total section size is being reported vs how it's being calculated internally.

## Key Findings

### 1. mstflint's BOOT2 Size Calculation

From analyzing `mstflint/mlxfwops/lib/fs4_ops.cpp`:

```cpp
int Fs4Operations::getBoot2Size(u_int32_t address)
{
    u_int32_t num_of_dwords = 0;
    // Read the num of DWs for the second dword
    READBUF((*_ioAccess), address + 4, &num_of_dwords, 4, "num of DWs");
    TOCPU1(num_of_dwords)
    return (4 + num_of_dwords) * 4; // 2 dwords for header + 2 dwords for tail
}
```

**Formula**: `total_size = (4 + num_of_dwords) * 4`

Breaking this down:
- 2 dwords (8 bytes) for header
- `num_of_dwords` dwords for the actual data
- 2 dwords (8 bytes) for tail (includes CRC)

### 2. BOOT2 Structure

From `FwOperations::CheckBoot2` in `fw_ops.cpp`:

```cpp
_fwImgInfo.boot2Size = (size + 4) * 4;
```

Where `size` is the value read from offset 4 (the size_dwords field).

### 3. CRC Verification

The CRC is stored at position `(size + 3) * 4` bytes from the start:

```cpp
u_int32_t crc_act = buff[size + 3];  // CRC is at dword position size+3
```

### 4. Actual BOOT2 Section Analysis

From the test BOOT2 file (`BOOT2_0x00001000.bin`):
- File size: 14700 bytes (0x396C)
- Header magic: 0x20400040
- Size dwords field: 0x00000E57 (3671 dwords)
- Expected total size: (3671 + 4) * 4 = 14700 bytes (0x396C)
- CRC location: offset 0x3968 (last 4 bytes before 0x396C)

## The 4-byte Difference Issue

The issue appears to be in how mlx5fw-go is interpreting or displaying the size:

1. **mlx5fw-go reports**: size `0x003968`
2. **mstflint reports**: size `0x00396C`
3. **Difference**: 4 bytes

This 4-byte difference is exactly the size of the CRC field. Analysis of the extracted BOOT2 file shows:
- Actual file size: 14700 bytes (0x396C) - matches mstflint
- CRC location: offset 0x3968 (the last 4 bytes)
- The mlx5fw-go reported size (0x3968) is the offset where the CRC starts

The issue is likely that mlx5fw-go is reporting the CRC offset instead of the total section size.

## Recommendations for Fix

1. **Verify Size Calculation**: Ensure mlx5fw-go uses the same formula as mstflint:
   ```go
   totalSize := (sizeDwords + 4) * 4
   ```

2. **Check Section Size Reporting**: The issue appears to be in how the section size is being displayed. When mlx5fw-go displays section information, it should report the full section size including the CRC, not just the data size up to the CRC.

3. **Fix the SIZE NOT ALIGNED Error**: The "SIZE NOT ALIGNED" message appears to be triggered incorrectly. The BOOT2 section size IS aligned (0x396C is divisible by 4). The issue might be:
   - The code is checking alignment on a truncated data buffer (missing the last 4 bytes)
   - Or the CRC is being excluded from the size calculation when it shouldn't be

4. **Verify Data Reading**: Ensure that when reading BOOT2 sections, mlx5fw-go:
   - Reads the full section including the CRC bytes
   - Uses the correct total size: `(sizeDwords + 4) * 4`
   - Includes the CRC in section size reporting

## Debug Commands Used

```bash
# Extract BOOT2 structure
hexdump -C BOOT2_0x00001000.bin | head -20

# Analyze with Python
python3 -c "
import struct
with open('BOOT2_0x00001000.bin', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
    magic = struct.unpack('>I', data[0:4])[0]
    size_dwords = struct.unpack('>I', data[4:8])[0]
    print(f'Size dwords: {size_dwords}')
    print(f'Expected total: {(size_dwords + 4) * 4} bytes')
"
```

## mstflint vs mlx5fw-go Implementation Comparison

### mstflint Implementation
```cpp
// From fs4_ops.cpp
int Fs4Operations::getBoot2Size(u_int32_t address)
{
    u_int32_t num_of_dwords = 0;
    // Read the num of DWs from the second dword
    READBUF((*_ioAccess), address + 4, &num_of_dwords, 4, "num of DWs");
    TOCPU1(num_of_dwords)
    return (4 + num_of_dwords) * 4; // 2 dwords for header + 2 dwords for tail
}

// From fw_ops.cpp::CheckBoot2()
_fwImgInfo.boot2Size = (size + 4) * 4;  // size is the value from offset 4
// CRC is at buff[size + 3] - i.e., at dword position size+3
```

### mlx5fw-go Implementation (from boot2_section.go)
```go
// Calculate expected data size
expectedSize := (s.SizeDwords + 4) * 4
// Extract code data (between header and CRC)
// The CRC is at position (size + 3) dwords from start
crcOffset := (s.SizeDwords + 3) * 4
```

The calculation is the same, so the issue is likely in:
1. How the size is being displayed/reported
2. Whether the full data including CRC is being read before the alignment check
