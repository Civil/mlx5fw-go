# BOOT2 CRC Calculation in mstflint

This document describes how mstflint calculates CRC for BOOT2 sections based on source code analysis and debugging.

## Key Findings

### 1. BOOT2 Section Structure

The BOOT2 section has the following structure:
```
Offset  Size  Description
0x00    4     Magic (0x20400040)
0x04    4     Size in dwords (excluding 4-dword header)
0x08    8     Reserved
0x10    N*4   Boot code data (N = size_dwords)
...     4     CRC (at offset (size_dwords + 3) * 4)
```

### 2. CRC Calculation Range

From `FwOperations::CheckBoot2` in `fw_ops.cpp`:
- The CRC is calculated over `size + 4` dwords
- This includes the header (4 dwords) + the code data (size dwords)
- The CRC itself (last dword) is **excluded** from the calculation
- This is implemented using the `CRC1n` macro which processes `n-1` dwords

### 3. CRC Algorithm

BOOT2 uses the standard software CRC16 algorithm:
- Initial value: 0xFFFF
- Polynomial: 0x100B
- Process data as 32-bit big-endian words
- For each 32-bit word, process bits from MSB to LSB
- After all data, process 16 more zero bits
- Final XOR with 0xFFFF

### 4. CRC Storage Format

The CRC is stored in the last dword of the section:
- Location: offset `(size_dwords + 3) * 4`
- Format: Lower 16 bits of the dword contain the CRC
- Upper 16 bits are typically 0x0000

Example from test:
```
Stored CRC dword: 0x0000f297
CRC value: 0xf297 (in lower 16 bits)
```

### 5. Implementation in mstflint

```cpp
// From fw_ops.cpp:336
CRC1n(crc, buff, size + 4);  // Calculate CRC over size+3 dwords
crc.finish();
u_int32_t crc_act = buff[size + 3];  // Get stored CRC from last dword
```

The `CRC1n` macro specifically excludes the last dword from calculation.

## Recommendations for mlx5fw-go

To correctly implement BOOT2 CRC verification:

1. Calculate CRC over all data except the last 4 bytes (CRC dword)
2. Use the software CRC16 algorithm (polynomial 0x100B)
3. Extract the expected CRC from the lower 16 bits of the last dword
4. Compare calculated vs expected CRC values

## Fix Implemented

The issue in mlx5fw-go was that the CRC comparison was using the full 32-bit value from the last dword, but BOOT2 only stores the CRC16 in the lower 16 bits (upper 16 bits are 0).

The fix involved:
1. Creating a specialized `Boot2CRCHandler` that:
   - Calculates CRC over the correct range (size_dwords + 3) * 4 bytes
   - Extracts the CRC from the lower 16 bits of the last dword
   - Compares only the 16-bit CRC values
2. Updating the section factory to use this handler for BOOT2 sections
3. The handler properly handles the dynamic CRC offset based on the size field

## Test Results

Using the test program on an actual BOOT2 section:
- Magic: 0x20400040
- Size: 4062 dwords (16248 bytes of code data)
- Total section size: 16264 bytes
- CRC calculated over: 16260 bytes (excluding last 4 bytes)
- Stored CRC: 0xf297 (in lower 16 bits of 0x0000f297)
- Verification: âœ“ Passed

This confirms that mstflint:
1. Calculates CRC over the entire section except the CRC dword
2. Stores the 16-bit CRC in the lower half of the last dword
3. Uses the software CRC16 algorithm for BOOT2 sections
