# HASHES_TABLE Section Investigation

## Problem Statement
The HASHES_TABLE section at 0x7000 is displayed in mstflint's sections output but not parsed by parseHashesTable(). This investigation aims to understand how mstflint creates and displays HASHES_TABLE sections.

## Key Findings

### 1. HASHES_TABLE Section Type
- HASHES_TABLE is defined as section type 0xfa in `flint_base.h`:
  ```cpp
  FS4_HASHES_TABLE = 0xfa,
  ```

### 2. Hardware Pointer for HASHES_TABLE
- The HASHES_TABLE location is determined by a hardware pointer (`_hashes_table_ptr`)
- This pointer is initialized from the hardware pointers structure in `fs4_ops.cpp`:
  ```cpp
  _hashes_table_ptr = hw_pointers.hashes_table_pointer.ptr;
  ```
- In your case, this hardware pointer points to 0x7000

### 3. HASHES_TABLE in ITOC
**The key insight**: HASHES_TABLE sections appear in the sections list because there's an ITOC entry of type 0xfa pointing to the hardware pointer address (0x7000).

This means:
- HASHES_TABLE is **not** created implicitly by mstflint
- HASHES_TABLE appears in the sections list because it exists as an ITOC entry in the firmware image
- The ITOC entry has type 0xfa and flash_addr pointing to 0x7000

### 4. Section Display Flow
When mstflint displays sections (via `verify showitoc` or in query output):
1. It reads ITOC entries from the firmware
2. For each ITOC entry, it displays the section information
3. If an ITOC entry has type 0xfa (HASHES_TABLE), it will be displayed as "HASHES_TABLE" 

The relevant code in `verifyTocEntries()`:
```cpp
if (show_itoc)
{
    image_layout_itoc_entry_dump(&tocEntry, stdout);
    // ... additional verification
}
```

### 5. Why parseHashesTable() Isn't Called
The parseHashesTable() function is likely called when:
- Verifying the HASHES_TABLE section's internal structure
- Performing cryptographic operations that require hash validation
- During secure boot verification

However, for simple section listing, mstflint only needs to:
1. Read ITOC entries
2. Display their type and location
3. No need to parse internal structure

## Conclusion
HASHES_TABLE sections are displayed in mstflint output because:
1. They exist as ITOC entries (type 0xfa) in the firmware image
2. The ITOC entry points to the location specified by the hardware pointer (0x7000)
3. mstflint displays all ITOC entries when showing sections
4. No special handling is needed - HASHES_TABLE is treated like any other ITOC section

## Recommendations for Implementation
1. When parsing sections, check for ITOC entries of type 0xfa
2. These entries represent HASHES_TABLE sections
3. The flash_addr field in the ITOC entry contains the offset (e.g., 0x7000)
4. To fully parse HASHES_TABLE content, you would need to implement logic similar to mstflint's HASHES_TABLE verification code
