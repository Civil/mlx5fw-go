# ARM Boot Arguments Section Analysis

## Overview
The firmware contains an undocumented section that stores ARM boot arguments. This section is modified in the "franken_fw.bin" test case but is not verified by mstflint.

## Section Structure

The full section spans from 0x28C to 0x540 (692 bytes), bounded by 0xFFFF padding patterns. Within this larger section, the boot arguments structure is located at offset 0x4D0-0x500:

```
Offset    Size    Description
--------  ------  --------------------------------------------
0x4D0     6       Reserved/flags (all zeros in samples)
0x4D6     2       Length field (0x0249 = 585 in both samples)
0x4D8     32      Board ID string (null-padded C string)
                  - Original: "MBF2M345A-HECO"
                  - Modified: "MBF2M345A-VENOT_ES"
0x4F8     4       Unknown value (0x000109D8 in both samples)
0x4FC     2       Reserved (zeros)
0x4FE     2       CRC16 checksum (stored as big-endian)
```

## Key Findings

1. **Purpose**: This section contains a board/device identifier string that is likely passed as command line arguments to the ARM core during boot.

2. **Fixed Structure**: The section uses a fixed 32-byte field for the board ID string, regardless of actual string length. The string is null-terminated and padded with zeros.

3. **CRC Verification**: The section includes a 16-bit CRC at offset 0x4FE, but I was unable to determine the exact CRC algorithm used. Tested algorithms include:
   - 23+ standard CRC16 variants (CCITT, ARC, MODBUS, XMODEM, etc.)
   - mstflint's Software CRC16 (poly 0x100b, 32-bit word processing)
   - mstflint's Hardware CRC (with inverted first bytes)
   - Byte-by-byte CRC16 with mstflint polynomial (0x100b)
   - Both MSB-first and LSB-first bit processing
   - Different initialization values (0x0000, 0xFFFF, 0x1D0F, etc.)
   
   The CRC changes appropriately when the board ID is modified (0x6885 → 0x5220), suggesting it does protect this data.

4. **Not Part of Standard Sections**: This boot arguments section is not part of the ITOC/DTOC-defined sections and appears to be at a hardcoded offset within a larger reserved region.

## Recommendations

1. **Add Verification**: The mlx5fw-go tool should verify this section's CRC to detect tampering.

2. **Determine CRC Algorithm**: Further investigation is needed to determine the exact CRC16 variant used. Possibilities:
   - It may use a proprietary polynomial
   - The data range for CRC calculation might be different than tested
   - There might be additional transformations applied

3. **Structure Definition**: Add a proper struct definition for this boot arguments section:

```go
type ARMBootArgs struct {
    Reserved  [6]byte  // 0x4D0-0x4D5
    Length    uint16   // 0x4D6-0x4D7 (big endian)
    BoardID   [32]byte // 0x4D8-0x4F7 (null-terminated string)
    Unknown   uint32   // 0x4F8-0x4FB (possibly version or flags)
    Reserved2 uint16   // 0x4FC-0x4FD
    CRC16     uint16   // 0x4FE-0x4FF (big endian)
}
```

4. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Check if the length field (0x0249) relates to any other structure
   - Determine what the unknown value 0x000109D8 represents
   - Find the exact CRC algorithm by examining ARM boot code or related tools

## Additional Notes

### Section Boundaries
The larger section containing the boot arguments spans from 0x28C to 0x540 and includes:
- A repeating pattern (0xC688FAC6) from offset 0x2BE
- Various configuration data
- The boot arguments structure at 0x4D0-0x500
- Bounded by 0xFFFF padding patterns

### Test Results Summary
- Modified bytes properly identified: "HECO" → "VENOT_ES" at offset 0x4E2
- CRC changes accordingly: 0x6885 → 0x5220  
- Structure appears consistent between samples
- Tested 23+ standard CRC16 algorithms without finding an exact match
- Also tested mstflint's specific CRC implementations (Software and Hardware CRC)
- The CRC calculation method remains unknown but appears to be protecting the board ID data
- Likely uses a proprietary CRC algorithm specific to the ARM boot loader
